# DFT-PROJECT-SURE_TRUST
VLSI Design Project â€“ **Scan insertion with DRC and coverage analysis**

This project focuses on the implementation, modification, and verification of a digital design with a strong emphasis on Design Rule Check (DRC) compliance, clock rules, error correction, and Design for Testability (DFT).Gained practical expertise in Verilog for RTL coding and simulation, along with developing environments to
verify scan chains, stuck-at faults and logic failures etc.

**Project Objectives :**

Apply clock rules and terminology for reliable design timing.

Modify the design by integrating PLL and black box modules.

Identify, analyze, and resolve DRC and E5 violations.

Implement scan chain insertion to enhance testability.

Final design is error-free and testable
